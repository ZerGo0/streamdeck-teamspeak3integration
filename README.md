# TeamSpeak 3 Integration for Elgato Stream Deck

Allows you to interact with the TeamSpeak 3 Client via the ClientQuery (Telnet) with your Stream Deck

## Requirements

You need to have the [ClientQuery plugin](https://www.myteamspeak.com/addons/943dd816-7ef2-48d7-82b8-d60c3b9b10b3)
installed in your TeamSpeak 3 Client in order to use this plugin.

## Changelog

[v1.8](https://github.com/ZerGo0/streamdeck-teamspeak3integration/releases/tag/v1.8):

- Updated Newtonsoft.Json version to 13.0.1

[v1.7](https://github.com/ZerGo0/streamdeck-teamspeak3integration/releases/tag/v1.7):

- Added support for Channel Ids to the `Channel Switch` Action

[v1.6](https://github.com/ZerGo0/streamdeck-teamspeak3integration/releases/tag/v1.6):

- Fixed: "|" in `Change Nickname`, `Away Status Message` and so on not working
- Added `Channel Switch` Action which allows you to switch the channel when you press the button

[v1.5](https://github.com/ZerGo0/streamdeck-teamspeak3integration/releases/tag/v1.5):

- Fixed: Spaces in `Change Nickname`, `Away Status Message` and so on not working
- Added `Toggle INPUT (Local) Mute` Action which allows you to toggle the input mute status locally so that no one on
  the server can see it (Currently there is no dynamic way to update this status (couldn't find any public information
  about this), it will use the button state for now)

[v1.4](https://github.com/ZerGo0/streamdeck-teamspeak3integration/releases/tag/v1.4):
- All actions use 1 Telnet Client now (This should fix a lot of issues and hopefully it shouldn't use that much resources anymore when it fails to create a new Telnet connection)

[v1.3](https://github.com/ZerGo0/streamdeck-teamspeak3integration/releases/tag/v1.3):

- Added `Toggle AFK Status` Action which allows you to toggle the away status, input and output mute when you press the
  button

- Added `Toggle Away Status` Action which allows you to toggle the away status when you press the button

[v1.1](https://github.com/ZerGo0/streamdeck-teamspeak3integration/releases/tag/v1.1):
- It should now mute you on the currently selected server tab
- Renamed Plugin Category and Action Names
- Added Detailed Guide for the API-Key Setup: [Here](https://github.com/ZerGo0/streamdeck-teamspeak3integration/blob/master/Docs/API%20Key%20Guide.md)

[v1.0](https://github.com/ZerGo0/streamdeck-teamspeak3integration/releases/tag/v1.0):
- Added 2 buttons to toggle the mute status for the Input and Output on the TS3 Client
- Automatically update the buttons states depending on the state on the TS3 Client

## Possible improvements

- ~~1 Telnet Client/Connection for all actions (definitely needed for more actions in the future, the TS3 Client can't
  handle too many connections)~~ ✔️ Done
- ~~ClientQuery API-Key shared across all actions~~
